### Modify Existing Schemas
1. Go to `/schemas` in your dashboard
2. Click "Edit" on any sample schema
3. Add, remove, or modify fields as needed

### Best Practices for Schema Fields

**Good Field Names:**

- `project_code` (business-relevant)
- `hourly_rate` (precise)

**Good Descriptions:**
- "Unique invoice identifier from vendor system"
- "Internal project tracking code"
- "Billable rate per hour in USD"

**Avoid:**
- Generic names like `field1`, `data`, `info`
- Vague descriptions like "some number" or "text field"

## üîÑ Migration from Legacy System

If you're currently using the 21-field accounting system:

1. **Analyze your current fields** - Which ones do you actually use?
2. **Create a custom schema** with only the fields you need
3. **Add industry-specific fields** that the legacy system didn't support
4. **Test with sample documents** before switching completely
5. **Set as default** when you're ready to switch

## üìä Excel Export Benefits

With custom schemas, your Excel exports will contain:
- **Only relevant fields** for your industry
- **Proper field names** that match your business terminology
- **Organized data** that makes sense for your workflows
- **No empty columns** from unused legacy fields

## üéØ Testing Your Schemas

1. **Upload test documents** with different schemas selected
2. **Check field extraction accuracy** - are the right values being found?
3. **Export to Excel** - does the data look correct?
4. **Send test emails** - do they route to the right schema?
5. **Refine field descriptions** based on AI extraction results

## üí° Tips for Success

- **Start simple** - begin with 6-8 core fields, add more later
- **Use business language** - field names should match your terminology  
- **Provide context** - good descriptions help AI understand what to extract
- **Test iteratively** - try different documents and refine your schema
- **One schema per workflow** - don't try to make one schema do everything

1. Check the field extraction results in document details
2. Review the AI confidence scores for each field
3. Adjust field descriptions to be more specific
